# JuliaDB tutorial

This repository contains a simple tutorial on data manipulations using [JuliaDB](http://juliadb.org/latest/).

Porting tutorials from more mature data manipulation packages can potentially help in figuring out strength and weaknesses of data manipulation packages in Julia.

The tutorial is built using [Weave.jl](https://github.com/mpastell/Weave.jl) and is available [here](https://piever.github.io/JuliaDBTutorial/).
